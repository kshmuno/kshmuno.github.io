Hmmm... how do I know if the server is up, without logging into it. Because thats what I need to do right now.... Oh, I guess I could anydesk into it. that should work I guess.

Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.... well thats not gonna work... at least for the bot... maybe ill be able to figure it out... lets see if it comes up when I log in at least.

Thats it, no more discord update messages at night. Ive had it. You can get a screenshot, or ill sync this file to google drive and make it a link for you or something. or pastebin, or github, something, im going to make something work, that allows you to read a message that is over 2000 characters... I will spend the time to find a solution to this problem. You know what, screw it. We are going to date them. Its going to be a rolling file. And ill find a way to get it to you. Thats a new goal for tonight... and finish the server stuff im working on, and start new show, at least 2 episodes of new show.

okay, server restart test, lets see what happens here.. Does my music bot come back up? also just got the email for teamspeak, guess I took my time signing into the server.... whoooops ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Music bot did not start... why didnt it startIts in the services as not started... but why.

hmmmmmmmmmmm why you no work

Okay, music bot doesnt work... guess ill have to get to that one another day and figure out how to make jar files work, lets check up on teamspeak

also lets see if anyone was there. they should have rejoined.... I think.... Okay, says noone was here.

yep, noone was there, saved

Okay, teamspeak was an easy one actually. Lets see if it works for real. Unlike the dumb music bot.

Server really is getting a lot of restarts today.
I just realized that my primary DNS is a thing run by the server.... I should really have a secondary... that isnt run on the server... thats not a fun thing to have die on me... have a secondary DNS computer.... see if you like that.

Oh hell yeah, teamspeak works. Comes up automatically without having to login to the server. Thats nice to know. Convinient for sure.

Okay, onto the next task. Figuring out a way for you to get your dumb text from me. Because obviously I type too much to you now.
